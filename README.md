CpPress Scaffold Theme
===

Hi. I'm a starter theme called `CpPress Scaffold Theme`, or `cp-press-scaffold-theme`.
I've been developed to get a fast and simply scaffold theme to use with the `CpPress Plugin`, that is required to run me.


Remember
---------------
Remember to change labels and filename as following:
   - Rename all labels from `cppress` to your site name in `functions.php`
   - Rename all scripts and styles filename from `cppress` to your site name
